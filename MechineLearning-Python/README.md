# MechineLearning Basic By Python

This is a Basic MachineLearning course powered by Python 3 in Japan's University.
Projects could directly implement by Python compiler, but LectureNotes should use [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com/).

# Guidance

## Recommandation

You could just use Google Colaboratory to access LectureNotes(.ipynb) and Assignments(.py).

I would show you how to do it:

1. Clik "File" Tab in the Tab bar.
2. Choose "Open Notebook" and clik it.
3. Choose "GitHub" in Tab bar.
4. Type my URL "https://github.com/PeterWrighten" in "Enter a GitHub URL or search by organization or user".
5. Check My Repo " MachineLearning" and choose the Lecture or Assign File which you wanna implement, then enjoy it(lol).

## Normal Way

You could also just download the code files in this repo and implement it in commandline or IDE, whatever you prefer.
